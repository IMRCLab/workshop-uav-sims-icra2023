          The workshop aims to provide the participants with the knowledge and experience of researchers who have struggled to find, customize, or design a robotic simulator for their own purposes or specific application. The focus is on aerial vehicles, especially multi-rotor aircraft, where we expect simulation solutions to be of continued importance for both research and industrial applications.
          Simulating UAVs is a specialized task, because of aerodynamic interactions (with the environment or other robots), the fast operating speed compared to other robots (e.g., mobile, legged), and the potentially large number of interacting robots in three dimensions (e.g., swarms of delivery drones).
